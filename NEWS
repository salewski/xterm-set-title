* xterm-set-title 0.1.0 (2020-??-??)

** Initial version of project.

   The project currently provides a single program, 'xterm-set-title', and
   it's man page, xterm-set-title(1).

   The 'xterm-set-title' program provides a simple mechanism for setting the
   title of the current xterm(1) (that is, the xterm window that is running
   the shell (or whatever) from which you invoke the 'xterm-set-title'
   program. This is similar setting the title on the window (X11 frame) by
   using the '-title' command line option to xterm, but 'xterm-set-title' can
   be run at any time (not just a program startup).
